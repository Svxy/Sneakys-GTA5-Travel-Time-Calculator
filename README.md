<p align=center>A simple compact and responsive tailwind user interface that allows a user to input their speed and distance values from GTA 5 or FiveM, and calculate how long it will take to travel that distance at that speed. I didnt do too much research before diving into this project and data used for calculations are from <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/a3ofy9/gta_v_in_game_miles/'>this</a>, so accuracy may not always be 100%, it's also midnight and I'll probably expand on this a bit more and test for accuracy / make changes based on what I find if anything at all eventually.<br><br>In the mean time, feel free to fork the repo and make some changes/improvments for a pull request!</p>
